## History

The Enigma was an electromechanical cipher machine developed by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. It was used for encrypting confidential commercial and military messages by various countries. It became widely known for its use by the Germans during World War II, which inspired the movie The Imitation Game. The film depicts part of the life of the genius Alan Turing, who developed a machine capable of breaking Enigma's ciphers. It is estimated that this invention shortened the war by two years and saved about 14 million lives.

## Running the Program

Override the message variable in the /cmd/main.go file with the message you want to encrypt, then open the project folder in the terminal and run the command:

```
$ go run ./cmd/main.go
```
